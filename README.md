traitify-unity3d
================

- a traitify library that works out of the box with unity3d

- Please replace the public and secret keys with your own APIKEY_public,secret
- uses an intermediary server to transfer unity's post to a put for updating responses
- Uses JSONObject and Unity's WWW directly (no external libraries)
- run the test scene to take an exam and see what personality type you are!

- when you are ready to go to production, switch the base url APIURL_base to production server


Note: TraitifyUI.cs in the sample scene is one sample "controller" usage of LibTraitify, which pulls the various data assets into each corresponding unity data structures
